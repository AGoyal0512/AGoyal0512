## Hey there! 👋

I'm Agam Goyal, a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, majoring in Computer Science and Data Science, and doing a minor in Economic Analytics. Over the last 2 years, I've been interested in data science and machine learning, and deeply inspired by their utility in various fields today.
