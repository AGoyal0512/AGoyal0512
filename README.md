## Hey there! 👋

I'm Agam Goyal, a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin - Madison majoring in Computer Science and Data Science, and minoring in Economic Analytics and Mathematics. For the last 2 years, I've been interested in data science and machine learning, and deeply inspired by their utility in various fields today. 

Apart from focusing on the learning from classwork, I like to augment my skills by involving myself in extra-curricular activities like clubs, active research work, directed studies and independent projects. 

My GitHub profile contains code and deliverables from the projects I work on and competitions I participate in.
