## Hey there! üëã

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), where I am working on making large language models more aligned with human values and their applications in social settings. My work is graciously supported in part by the [Cohere For AI Research Grant Program](https://cohere.com/blog/c4ai-research-grants) and the [OpenAI Researcher Access Program](https://openai.com/form/researcher-access-program/). See [my website](https://agoyal0512.github.io) for more details on my past and current research interests.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) where I graduated with a B.S. with [Comprehensive Honors](https://honors.ls.wisc.edu/honors-degree-tracks/#comprehensive-honors), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), [Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/), and [Data Science](https://datascience.wisc.edu/), with a minor in [Economic Analytics](https://econ.wisc.edu/).

Over the last two summers, I worked as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern at [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the EC2 Modernization team (2024), developing an RAG-based framework for decompiled C# source code summarization, and on the [Alexa](https://twitter.com/alexa99) Devices Speech Middleware team (2023), working on making it easier for applications to achieve Alexa Voice Integration and built an application to help automate the end-to-end testing of Alexa's Speech functionalities.
